# HEIF
Mac OS X 10.13.4+: Convert any image to HEIF/HEIC format

Usage: ```HEIF [-q=quality] <image>```
where quality is in range from 0.1 (max compression) to 1.0 (lossless), default is 0.76

Compiling on macOS (to create executable `HEIF` and copying to `bin` folder):

```sh
cd HEIF
swiftc -O -o HEIF main.swift
cp HEIF /usr/local/bin
```

Or simply run from terminal without compilation:

```sh
./main.swift <image1> [optional image2] [optional image3] [...]
```

Please note: odd image dimensions will be truncated by Apple's codec to even ones. 

## Swift 5 runtime

Starting with Xcode 10.2, Swift 5 command line programs you build require the Swift 5 runtime support libraries built into macOS. These libraries are included in the OS starting with macOS Mojave 10.14.4. When running on earlier versions of macOS, [this package](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1998?locale=en_US) must be installed to provide the necessary Swift 5 libraries.
